## About Me

### Soohwan Kim @sooftware   

#### AI Research Engineer ㆍ Software Developer 
  
I would like to introduce myself as an AI research engineer rather than a research scientist. My dream is to create conversational A.I. who people emotionally engage with - so I am very interested in deep learning techniques such as speech recognition, speech synthesis, open-domain dialogue, and model parallelism. Recently I began a startup with 5 co-founding members - all of them were my teammates at Kakao Brain. We named our startup TUNiB. We are looking for talented colleagues to work with. You can check more information on our website. If you are interested, please don't hesitate to contact me. (kaki.ai@tunib.ai)
